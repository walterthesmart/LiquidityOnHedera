# Liquidity on Hedera - Comprehensive Presentation Prompt

## Project Overview for Presentation AI

You are creating a presentation for **Liquidity on Hedera**, a revolutionary decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that democratizes access to Nigerian capital markets through blockchain technology. This is a comprehensive tokenized Nigerian Stock Exchange (NGX) trading platform built on the Hedera Hashgraph network.

## üéØ Core Value Proposition

**Liquidity** solves the critical problem of limited access to Nigerian capital markets by creating a 24/7, globally accessible, blockchain-based trading platform for tokenized Nigerian stocks. The platform enables:
