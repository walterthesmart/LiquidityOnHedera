# LiquidityOnHedera - Project Overview

## What is LiquidityOnHedera?

LiquidityOnHedera is a revolutionary platform that brings Nigerian stock market trading to the blockchain. Built on Hedera's fast and secure network, it allows users to buy, sell, and trade tokenized versions of real Nigerian stocks like Dangote Cement, MTN, and Zenith Bank.

Think of it as a digital stock exchange where traditional Nigerian stocks are converted into digital tokens. Users can purchase these stock tokens using Nigerian Naira (NGN) stablecoin, trade them instantly, and build diversified portfolios - all powered by blockchain technology.

The platform combines familiar stock trading with modern blockchain benefits: faster transactions, lower fees, 24/7 trading, and transparent ownership records. It's designed to make Nigerian stock market investing more accessible to everyone, whether you're a seasoned investor or just starting your financial journey.
